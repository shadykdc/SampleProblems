# Sample Problems

I'm just practicing some sample problems from Cracking the Coding Interview, Elements of Programming Interviews, etc.

### addOne.cpp
Given a number represented as an array of numbers 0-9, add one to that number.

For example: [2,0,9] => [2,1,0] or [9,9] => [1,0,0]

### binSearchRotatedArray.cpp
Use binary search to find an integer in a circular sorted list of integers where the start of the list is unknown.

For example: find 3 in the following list using binary search: [6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5]

### crossword.cpp
Determine if a grid of black and white squares (2D array of 0's and 1's) is a valid crossword puzzle (i.e. if all of the white squares are connected).

### linkedListPalindrome.cpp
Determine if the given linked list is a palindrome.

### maxSubarraySum
Of all the possible subarrays in a given array, find the one with the largest sum. Return that sum.

### parser.cpp
Make a csv parser where a row and column delimiter is given with an input string and a 2D array is returned.

If there are quotation marks, ignore any delimiters inside the quotation marks.

### sayTheNumber.cpp
Given an integer, output the english version of the number.

For example: -10,234 would be negative ten thousand two hundred thirty four.
